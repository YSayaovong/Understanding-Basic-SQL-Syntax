# Understanding Basic SQL Syntax

## Overview
This project is focused on developing a foundational understanding of SQL (Structured Query Language). It includes exercises and examples that cover basic SQL syntax, querying data from relational databases, and performing essential database operations like creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD).

## Features
- Writing SQL queries to interact with relational databases
- Basic SQL commands: `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`
- Database structure: tables, columns, rows
- Filtering and sorting data using `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, and `GROUP BY`
- Joining tables using `JOIN`
- Aggregate functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`
- Query optimization for efficient data retrieval
